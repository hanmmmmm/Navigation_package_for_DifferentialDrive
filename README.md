# navigation_package_V1
This is my implementation of a complete 2D navigation package, including global planner, local planner, and motion controller.

Two simulators are used. 
- The first is <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/stage/Tutorials/SimulatingOneRobot"> stage_ros </a>. 
    - It uses a bmp image to build the world. I draw my map using this bitmap tool <a href="https://www.pixilart.com/"> <i>pixilart</i> </a> .
    - It creates a differential-drive robot with 2D lidar.

- The second is Gazebo with <a href="https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/"> turtlebot </a> . 
    - The map is turtlebot_house.
    - The turtlebot robot is a differential-drive robot with 2D lidar. It also has RGBD cameras though not used in this project. 


For slam, I am using the standard Gmapping.

### ROS messages being used:
- geometry_msgs:  Twist, PoseStamped
- sensor_msgs:  LaserScan
- nav_msgs:  OccupancyGrid, MapMetaData, Odometry, Path 
- tf/transform_listener



### C++ libraries used:
- ros/ros.h
- vector, array, queue, string
- atomic, thread
- iostream, chrono, stdexcept, iomanip
- set, map, unordered_map
- limits, algorithm, math.h


### To-Do
- Add algos from random-tree family, and compare with the A* family here.
- Add MPC Model-predictive-controller.
- Add potential field method for path planning.

### Global goal and Global path

The line of green arrows is the path, from current location to the goal location.

This example is using A* algorithm to find the path. 

Each path-finding takes <1~20 ms. The more obstacles between robot and goal, the longer time it takes to find the valid path.

But this node is set to update the global path about 2~3 Hz even though it could do much faster, since global path doesn't need to be updated too frequently. 

Here I am dragging the robot in Stage simulator by hand.

### Local goal and Local path

The green arrows are global path, and the red ones are local path.

This example is using Hybrid-A* to find the local path. The local goal is the last glocal path-point covered inside the local search area (The white square area around the robot base_link). 

This is also a full working demo actually, since the robot is moving following the <i>cmd_vel</i> message generated by my controller module.

### Working demo

<b>Stage sim</b>
Several new goals are added while the robot is moving. The paths are updated to guide the robot. 

The controller module use <i>odometry</i> and <i>local_path</i> to generate the disired linear & angular velocity for the robot to follow the <i>local_path</i>. 

In the planning module, the unkown region (dark green) is treated the same as clear region (bright white).  Becasue the global planning is consantly updating the global path, a new path will be found if the existing path pass through a new-found obstacle.

### RQT_graph

This is the workflow within the system. 

The nodes <i>StageROS</i> and <i>GMapping</i> are standard ROS packages. 

The rest 3 modules are developed by myself.
